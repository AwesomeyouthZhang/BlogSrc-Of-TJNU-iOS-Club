I am a senior undergaduate Software Engineeering student at Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China. I am also a key member of the Cognitive and Affective Computing Lab advised by Prof. Ziping Zhao at TJNU. I love both research and industrial, I had a wonderful internship experience at Baidu DuerOS department major in web development.

My research at TJNU is focused on applied machine learning and affective computing. If you are interested, checkout my selected projects and publications at below. There are also a few creative open source application projects.
